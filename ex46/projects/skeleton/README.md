1. Read about how to use all of the things you installed.
A Ruby “gem” is a self-contained library or program. It is distributed by RubyGems, a packet manager. RubyGems makes it easy to install gems and to distribute gems. A gem contains code, documentation, and a gemspec.

NAME.gemspec – a gemspec is a file that contains information for a gem.
bin – bin stands for binaries, it is where the binary (executable) files go!
(bin does NOT stand for ‘garbage bin’ as previously thought…
remember when the trash used to have a /usr/local/bin path?)
doc – this directory is where you put the documentation for your gem
lib – this directory is where you put the code for the gem.
Rakefile – this is the file that the rake program uses to automate tests and generate code
data – this directory is a place to store application data (for example, database, cache, session files).
ext – this directory is for the extensions of your application.
tests – this directory is where you put the tests for the gem
